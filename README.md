<h1>St Lawrence School of Football - Inspiring Excellence</h1>
<p>St Lawrence School of Football is an amateur, youth, community football club based in North West London. They are a club that have helped and developed many young talented footballers players, some even going on to play professionally in the football leagues. As a community charity-funded football club, they're always on the lookout for local talent, both on and off the field. That means, to continue their good work, they require players, coaches or volunteers to be able to find them and join the club. They also require a location where existing players, parents and staff can go to find out details of upcoming matches and games. Therefore, this website aims to serve both existing and new players, volunteers and coaches; to educate on the ethos of the club, introduce them to the coaches, allow them to contact the club, and inform them of important match/training details.</p>
